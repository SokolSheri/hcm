## About Compfood
This project was the final assignment for my CIS major. The application was built for a non-profit organization that needed a management system for company operations and volunteer scheduling. 

## How it works
The system has three distinct users (admin, volunteers, and donors). 
Admin : Once an Admin logs into the system they are able to add/remove volunteers to/from their roster, schedule volunteers, edit volunteer information, and record company transactions to the database.
Volunteers : Volunteers can log into the work portal and look at their schedule for the week. They can also edit their own personal information and work availability.
Donors : Donors can send donations.
